# Python Programs
I will be periodically updating this repository with useful python programs. 

## [Batch Translator](https://github.com/moghimi/python/tree/main/Batch-Translator)
It is a simple code to retrieve related information such as definition, translation, synonyms and, antonyms for given words list. Words are read from a text file named 'words.txt' which is located in same path as the python file. After processing words, retrieved information will be saved into a CSV file named 'words.csv'.
